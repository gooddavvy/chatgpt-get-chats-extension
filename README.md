# What is it?

![image](chatgpticon.png)

Our goal is to create a Chrome Extension that extracts all of the messages in correct in a certain ChatGPT chat. It will actually tell you the messages only if you are currently on a tab that says or starts with ["chat.openai.com/chat"](chat.openai.com/chat) no matter how many messages are that.

## Can show me a list of your contributors?
