# What is it?

![image](chatgpticon.png)

Our goal is to create a Chrome Extension that extracts all of the messages in correct in a certain ChatGPT chat. It will actually tell you the messages only if you are currently on a tab that says or starts with ["chat.openai.com/chat"](chat.openai.com/chat) no matter how many messages are that.

And, you must read the [Laws of Reading Source Code](MUSTREAD.md#laws-of-reading-source-code) before looking at the source code. There are some laws. If we find out that you disobey any of the laws, we may comment one of your repos and say something that you may not like. If you don't however have any repos, we may block your GitHub account from us and for at least 14 days.

## Can show me a list of your contributors?
