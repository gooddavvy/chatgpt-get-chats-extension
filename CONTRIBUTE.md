# So, how do I contribute to your Chrome Extension?

First, in order to make changes to our extension, you need to spot a bug. You will also need a GitHub account. You can put it in the Issues tab here on GitHub, and shortly we will reply to your issue comment on GitHub.

If you receive a reply that says "Accepted." inside of the reply, you can fork our repository and try to fix the issue. Test the extension, you aren't allowed to publish it to Chrome Webstore, and if it resolves the issue you found, you can submit a pull request to our repository, then if we think if it is good, we will merge the pull request you submitted.

Otherwise, if you receive a reply that says "Not Accepted.", that means that the issue in our extension has either been fixed by ourselves, or the issue is not true.

Thank you for your contributions, we would love to get support & feedback from you! And if you have any questions, don't hesitate to ask!
